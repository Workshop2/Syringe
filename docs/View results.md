#Viewing results

On the header menu you have two options:

 1. All results
 2. Today's results

They both show the same information except today's results shows results only from today whereas all results shows results up to a year.

####Filter Results

By default results from all environments will be shown. 

In order to change this you must do the following:

 1. Click on the "Environment" Button
 2. Choose the environment from the drop down.

Results are limited to 20 per page. You can change this by adding/changing the noOfResults parameter in the querystring to a different number.
